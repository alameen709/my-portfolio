# Town Tourist Website Design

## Design Decisions
- Navigation: I chose a simple and clear navigation bar for easy access to different sections.
- Layout: I used Bootstrap's grid system to create a responsive layout that adapts to various screen sizes.
- Color Choices: The color palette was inspired by the town's natural surroundings, using calming earthy tones.

## Challenges Faced
- Integrating the map from OpenStreetMap required adjusting the iframe dimensions to fit the layout.
- Achieving a balanced ratio between content columns while maintaining readability.
